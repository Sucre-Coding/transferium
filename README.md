REST API for accounts and payments in Kotlin.

## Objectives of Transferium

### Learn Kotlin

With this project I'm aiming to explore Kotlin as a programming language.
After this project is completed I would like to have a better grasp on Kotlin's
idioms, be comfortable jumping from Java to Kotlin and using its features.

## Features

* List accounts and their balances
